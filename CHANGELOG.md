# Changelog

All notable changes to AgentCordon are documented in this file.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **RFC 8628 Device Authorization Grant** for workspace registration. The broker prints a 4-word passphrase user code and an activation URL; users approve the registration from any browser, on any host — matching the `gh auth login`, `az login --use-device-code`, and `aws sso login` pattern. New endpoints: `POST /oauth/device/code`, `POST /oauth/token` (extended with the `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code` grant), and `GET/POST /activate` with `GET /activate/success`. New `device_codes` table. New audit events: `DeviceCodeIssued`, `DeviceCodeApproved`, `DeviceCodeDenied`, `DeviceCodeExpired`.
- **Windows PowerShell installer** — one-liner `irm https://<server>/install.ps1 | iex`. Downloads both `agentcordon.exe` and `agentcordon-broker.exe` from the GitHub release, verifies SHA-256 checksums, installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AgentCordon\bin`, and adds that directory to the user PATH. New server route `GET /install.ps1` serves the templated installer. (`tools/install.ps1`)
- Broker now runs on Windows with the same lifecycle as on Unix: started from a terminal, dies with the terminal, no Windows service required.

### Changed

- Workspace registration UX: users copy a 4-word code into a browser instead of waiting for a loopback redirect. No more ephemeral listener on the broker host.

### Breaking

- **Workspace registration now uses RFC 8628 device flow exclusively.** The previous loopback Authorization Code flow has been removed, along with the broker's ephemeral HTTP listener. Any automation that drove the old loopback callback will stop working. There is no `--legacy-loopback` flag. **Existing registered workspaces are unaffected** — their refresh tokens continue to work and no re-registration is required.

### Fixed

- **Broker works on a different host from the user's browser** — remote dev boxes, containers, headless servers, and SSH sessions. Previously the loopback callback required broker, browser, and server to share a host. This was the original headless-broker bug.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- **OAuth2 refresh token rotation** — the broker now persists rotated refresh tokens back to the server when an upstream OAuth provider issues a new `refresh_token` on exchange. Previously, rotated tokens were discarded with a warning, which broke any RFC 6749 §6-compliant provider (Notion, Google, OAuth 2.1 implementations) after the first refresh: the cached access token would mask the problem for ~1 hour, then every subsequent call would return 401 until manual re-consent. The fix is atomic — if the server-side persistence call fails, the new access token is also not cached, preventing state divergence across broker restarts. (`crates/broker/src/oauth2_refresh.rs`, new server endpoint `POST /api/v1/workspaces/mcp/rotate-refresh-token`)
  - **Recovery note**: users currently locked out of a rotating provider must re-authorize the MCP server once through the admin UI. The fix cannot recover refresh tokens that have already been invalidated by the upstream.

- **MCP server template URLs refreshed** — verified all 12 remote MCP templates in `data/mcp-templates/` against current vendor documentation and updated endpoints that had migrated from SSE to streamable HTTP. Changed URLs: `asana` (`/sse` → `/v2/mcp`, deprecating 2026-05-11), `cloudflare` (`/sse` → `/mcp`), `intercom` (`/sse` → `/mcp`), `wix` (`/sse` → `/mcp`). Transport aligned from `sse` to `http` on: `asana`, `atlassian`, `cloudflare`, `github`, `granola`, `intercom`, `linear`, `notion`, `sentry`, `wix`. Granola's `oauth2_resource_url` updated to include the `/mcp` path suffix to match its RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata. PayPal and Square kept on `/sse` since their vendor docs still publish that as canonical.

- **Release workflow publishes broker binary** — `build-broker` matrix added to `.github/workflows/release.yml`, mirroring the CLI's target set (5 targets including Windows). Previously, `/install.sh` served by the running server tried to download `agentcordon-broker-<target>` from GitHub releases and 404'd because no job was uploading it.

- **Linux binary glibc compatibility** — all three Rust build jobs (`build-gateway`, `build-broker`, `build-server`) now run on `ubuntu-22.04` (glibc 2.35) instead of `ubuntu-latest` (glibc 2.39). Fixes `GLIBC_2.38 not found` / `GLIBC_2.39 not found` errors on Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, and other distros with older glibc.

- **Install script `curl | sh` compatibility** — the install script served by `GET /install.sh` now re-execs itself under bash when invoked via `sh` (e.g. Debian/Ubuntu `/bin/sh` is dash, which doesn't support `set -o pipefail`). Users running `curl ... | sh` no longer get `Illegal option -o pipefail`.

- **Repository URL** — corrected stale `hotnops/AgentCordon` reference in workspace `Cargo.toml`.
